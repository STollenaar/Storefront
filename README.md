# Storefront

A Bukkit plugin (tested using Minecraft 1.15.2, running on PaperMC) to display the contents of chests on a server within a web interface.

*Note*: this is a personal project, if you think this is interesting enough that you want to host this yourself, create an issue, and I'll spend the time documenting the plugin install / what the web server that hosts this should do :)
